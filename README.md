# Slim Language Explorer

[Slim](https://github.com/slim-template/slim#configuring-slim) is a cool way to generate a potentially complex HTML block with a minimum of characters.
Most often, Slim is thought of as an alternative to Ruby on Rail's ERB, however it is useful in a broad range of contexts.

When you are trying to figure out how to express HTML in Slim, however, you inevitably rerun the generation process over and over.
This git project consists of a small Ruby program that launches Slim, whenever a file is modified, created or deleted within the project.
This allows you to edit the Slim 'program', and view its output each time you save it.


## Installation

$ gem install
